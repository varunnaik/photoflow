Photoflow
=========

Photoflow: View a continuously updated stream of photos    

Features:    
See a flowing list of photographs, updated continuously    
Search for a term - this will create a new flow that shows the search results (v2)    

UI:
---

The UI will consist of a small area at the top right of the prototype.
There will be three elements: 
 
1. A search box
2. A countdown timer for updates
3. A settings icon to choose update intervals and services
4. A small help/about link that will pop-up help in a new window

The UI must be smooth and responsive on phones, tablets, and desktop. Smooth transitions and animations must be used when adding or removing photos.

Services:
---------

Initial support for Flickr and Photobucket. More services (Imgur? Picasa? Google+? Facebook?) Will be supported later.
